that left the parking lot in that time frame.                                                          |

before I arrived at Emma's bakery, I was walking by the ATM on Leggett Street and saw the thief there
withdrawing some money.
                                                                                          |
| 163 | Raymond | As the thief was leaving the bakery, they called someone who talked to them for less
than a minute. In the call, I heard the thief say that they were planning to take the earliest flight
out of Fiftyville tomorrow. The thief then asked the person on the other end of the phone to purchase the flight ticket. */
