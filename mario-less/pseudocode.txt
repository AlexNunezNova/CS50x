First, there must be a user validation.
Use a do - while loop for this, for numbers smaller than 1 or higher than 8

Then, use an if loop with a counter i for the rows, and there will be an imbedded if loop with a counter j for the column
The first row will have just one block
The second row will have two blocks
And so on, until the n row that will have the n number of blocks submitted by the user.

The j counter will then depend on the i counter for that.
Then, to invert the pyramid we have to add some spaces.

The number of spaces on each row will be (n-(i+1)), and then will decrease on each row
